Servlet
  - A servelet is a Java class that is utilized to extend the capabilities of request-response programming model servers that host 
    applications. Servlets can interact or respond to any type of request, Servlets are maily used for extending applications hosted 
    by web servers.
Java Servlets
  - handles client requests by generating a response message
  - Java Servlets is hosted in a "servlet container" which is part of a web server that communicates with the servlet so that it will
    let Java to dynamically generate a web page from the server side. Servlet container also controls the servlet lifecycle
  - Pavni Diwanji created the Servlet1 while working at Sun Microsystems, with version 1.0 finalized in June 1997. As of now, 
    Servlet has 10 versions, from Servlet 1.0 to Servlet 4.0.
    Servlet 4.0 	Sep 2017 	       Java EE 8 	
    Servlet 3.1 	May 2013 	       Java EE 7

*Servlet lifecycle
1. initialization
  - The init() method will be called upon the creation of servlet and it is only called once.
2. request handling
  - Request handling is handled by the method service() which is basically the main method that handles the tasks of each request
    it uses multi-threading to do the tasks.
   - The service() method is called multiple times depending on the number of requests of the user.
3. destruction
- The destruction is handled by the method destroy() which is invoked the website? is done using the object method. 

HTTP Servlet
- used to handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses
- the service() method call is connected to a doXXX call (e.g. doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), doDelete())
- the doXXX() methods passes 2 arguements which are HTTPServletRequest and HTTPServletResponse

HTTPServletRequest
- used to access information from the request message
  (Needs to be put in a table)
  Method Summary
  https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html

HTTPServletResponse 
- used to access information from the response message
(Needs to be put in a table)
 Method Summary
 https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/ServletResponse.html
 


* The web container also facilitates the conversion from HTTP response to HTTPServletResponse or from HTTP request to HTTPServletRequest.

PHP
History
PHP originally stands for "Personal Home Page Tools". PHP was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdof. Later that year, he dropped the name PHP and changed it to FI, an abbreviation for Forms Interpreter. It was originally intended for forms in HTML. Though in the October of 1995, Rasmus released a rewritten code bringing back the name PHP but with the meaning "Personal Home Page Construction Kit". From this, it went through a lot of development process and these are the versions and there release date:
PHP 1.0 - June 8 1995

Introduction
In the following lessons, it is expected that you know HTML, CSS, JavaScript and setting up a web server.
PHP today means "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" and is known as a scripting language for server-side web development. It is used mainly for making webpages dynamic and interactive. PHP is server-side programming language that runs on web servers. This means that when it is executed, it is executed in the server and nowhere else. PHP scripts must run on web servers or it will not work.

Syntax
PHP scripts can be placed anywhere in an HTML or you can make a separate file with .php as the file extension.
PHP scripts start with <?php and ends with ?>.
Example:
<?php
	echo "Hello World!";
?> 
Note: PHP statements end with a semicolon(;).

Case Sensitivity
All PHP keywords, functions, classes, and user defined functions are NOT case-sensitive.
Example:
echo "Hello"; is the same as
EcHo "Hello";

Comments
To put single line comments, we use (//) or (#) followed by a word or a sentence.
To put multi-line comments, we use /* and */.
Example:
// Single line
# Single line
/*
 Multiline
 Multiline
*/

Variables
There are rules to follow when finding for the perfect variable name. These rules are:
 - The first character must be a dollar sign ($).
 - A variable name must be at least one character in length.
 - The character after the dollar sign ($) must either be a letter or an underscore (_) and following characters can be a letter, underscore or a number.
 - Spaces or special characters other than _ and $ are not allowed in any part of the variable name.
 Examples of legal variable names in PHP:
 	$_var
	$var
	$var_one
 Examples of illegal variable name in PHP:
	var
	$var one
	$var-one

Data Types
PHP has 8 data types mainly String, Integer, Float, Boolean, Array, Object, NULL, and Resource
A String is just a sequence of characters enclosed by either the single quotes or the double quotes.
Example:
$string = "Hello There";
$string_two = 'Hi there';

An Integer is a data type that is non-decimal.
Example:
$x = 219;
$y = 2;

A float is a number with a decimal point or exponential form.
Example:
$z = 12.345;

A boolean data type represents two possible values: either a TRUE or a FALSE.
Example:
$a = TRUE;
$b = FALSE;

An array is a special data type that can store multiple informations in one single variable.
Example:
$school = array("SCIS",1,"SABM",2);

An object is a data type which stores data and information and how those informations can be used.
Example:
class School {
	 function School() {
	   this->dept = "CS";
	 }
}

$sc = new School();
echo $sc->dept;

A NULL value is a special data type which can only have a value NULL. A variable with a null value is a variable with non value assigned to it.
Example:
$x = 3;
$x = null;

A Resource type is actually not a data type. It stores the reference to functions in external resources. One good example for this is a database call.

Java

JS
Javascript is a high level programming language built into Netscape 2.0 and later versions. It is part and parcel of HTML 
which gives the user to alter and create dynamic content within a webpage.The requisite to properly use Javascipt is having
suffecient knowledge and knowing how to use HTML and CSS.

How JavaScript makes Web Pages more Interactive
Access Contents - you can select any element, attributes, ot text from an HTML web page.
Modify Conntents - you can modify like adding elements, attributes and text to the page.

Javascript Fundamentals
DATATYPES
1. number
  - the datatype number can be a decimal integer, decimal floating point or a decimal scientific notation
  - you can also represent numbers with base 2,8, and 16
  - there are also special numbers which are infinity, -infinity, and NaN
  NOTE:
  Division with numbers will always result as a decimal floating point and beware of inexact result
  e.g.
  var num = 10;
  num = 1.5;
  num = 3.1e7;
2. string
  - the string datatype can be represented by a single quote ('') or a double qoute ("")
  e.g.
  var str = 'hi';
  str = "hello";
3. boolean
  - the boolean data type has two values. The first is the falsy values which is represented by false,null,0,'', and undefined. 
    The second is the truthy values which are the values other than the falsy values 
    e.g.
    var bol = false;
    bol = null;
    bol = true;
4. null and undefined
  e.g.
  var n = null;
  n = undefined;
5. Object
  - object tyoes coresponds to primitive data
  e.g.
  var obj = new String("string");
  obj = new Number(100);
  
  FUNCTIONS
  - functions in javascript lets you return any type of value you want. The parameters of a function can be any data type and it doesnt
    need to be consistent
  example of syntax:
  function fnc (a,b){
    if(a>b){
      return a;
    }else{
      return b;
    }
  }
  func(1,false);
  func("aas",null);
  
  There is an object called argument in javascript which is an array that treats the parameter of a function as a data inside the array
  example:
  function fnc1(a,b){
    console.log(argument[0]); //the output is whatever the value of a 
    console.log(argument[1]); //the output is whatever the value of b
  }
  
  There is a parameter called rest parameter which is represented by three dots (...). The rest parameter lets you have an
  indefinite number of parameter or argument in a function
  example
  function fnc2(a...b){
  }
  
 The function can also be represented as expressions
 example
 var func = function (a,b){return a/b;};
 The function can also represented as an arrow function expression
 var func1 = (a,b) => {var c = a/b; return c;};

ARRAYS
- Arrays in java script are dynamic in size and it allows sparse arrays
Methods used in arrays
1.push method
- Add a new item at the end of the array
e.g
var colors = ["red","blue","green"];
colors.push("yellow");
2.pop method
- Removes an item at the end of the array
e.g.
colors.pop();
3.unshift method
- Add a new item at the beginning of the array
e.g.
colors.unshift("white");
4.shift method
- Removes an item at the beginning of the array
e.g.
colors.shift();
5.sort method
- Sorts the elemets of the array in alphabetical oreder
e.g.
colors.sort();
6.reverse method
- Reverses the elements of the array
e.g.
colors.reverse();
7.forEach method
- forEach method calls the elements of the array one at a time
8.reduce method
- Reduces the the value of the array to single value
9.filter method
- Filters the elements of the array that passes the condition
10.map method
- Maps a function once for each elements of the array


EVENT HANDLING
Event Propagation - event propagation determines in which order the elements receive the event. There are two ways of event propagation mainly:

Capture Phase - with capturing, the first event to be captured and handled is the outermost elememt going to the innermost element.
ex. <div>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
In this example, assume that a click event happened on <li>, the order of propagation would then be from <div> to <ul> to <li>. 
Bubble Phase - with bubbling, the first event to be captured and handled is the innermost elememt going to the outermost element.
ex. <div>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
 In this example, assume that a click event happened on <li>, the order of propagation would then be from <li> to <ul> to <div>. 
 
Event Handler Registration 
- using an inline event attributes
- using addEventListener, removeEventListener, dispatchEvent
- using attachEvent, fireEvent

Event Objects Properties and Methods
- bubble
- eventPahse
- target
- current target
- preventDefault
- stopPropagation
- stopImmediatePropagation

JavaScripts API
Execution of Synchronous and Asynchronous Codes
  - JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language which means that it can only execute one statement at a time.
    Synchronous - this means that while a statement is being executed, following line of statements can't be executed.
    ex. console.log(" First ");
        console.log(" Second ");
        console.log(" Third ");
        In this example, when the statement console.log(" First "); is executed, following statements are blocked and cannot           be executed. The output should then be:
        First
        Second
        Third
    Asynchronous - this means that while a statement is being executed, the next line of codes can be executed even though         current statement are executing. It may seem that a synchronous execution is straightforward but it can really be slow.
    With asynchronous execution, things can get faster especially with image processing, file operation and others.
    ex. console.log("1");
        setTimeout( function() {
          console.log("3");
        }
        console.log("2");
        In this exmaple, we used setTimeout(), let us say that the parameters for the function is setTimeout(callback, 2000).         It has the component callback and 2000 ms, callback will let the user know if the execution is done within the time of         2 seconds. The first statement is executed then the second one which is the function setTimeout(). While it is                 executing, lines after it can be executed. After 2 seconds, callback is now triggered and the statement is now                 executed. The output should then be:
        1
        2
        3
XMLHttpRequest Object
  - with this object, updating the parts of the webpage with reloading the whole page is possible.
  - XMLHttpRequest Object is used to give and take data with a server in background.
  Some properties of this objects are:
    - status
    - statusText
    - responseText
    - responceXML
    - readyState
    - onreadystatechange
    
Promise Object
    - Promise Objects may produce a single value some toime in the future that can be either a resolve value or a rejected value. A promise can have 3 states mainly: fulfilled, pending, or rejected. Promises are eager, that means that a promise will start doing task you give it as soon as the promise constructor is invoked.
    How it works:
    If the state is fulfilled, onFulfilled() will be called (e.g. resolve())
    If the state is rejected, onRejected() will be called (e.g. reject())
If the state is pending, it is notyet fulfilled or rejected

JSP
JSP(JavaServer Pages) provides a quick way to alter or create dynamic web content.
