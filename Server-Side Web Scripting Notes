Servlet
  - A servelet is a Java class that is utilized to extend the capabilities of request-response programming model servers that host 
    applications. Servlets can interact or respond to any type of request, Servlets are maily used for extending applications hosted 
    by web servers.
Java Servlets
  - handles client requests by generating a response message
  - Java Servlets is hosted in a "servlet container" which is part of a web server that communicates with the servlet so that it will
    let Java to dynamically generate a web page from the server side. Servlet container also controls the servlet lifecycle
  - Pavni Diwanji created the Servlet1 while working at Sun Microsystems, with version 1.0 finalized in June 1997. As of now, 
    Servlet has 10 versions, from Servlet 1.0 to Servlet 4.0.
    Servlet 4.0 	Sep 2017 	       Java EE 8 	
    Servlet 3.1 	May 2013 	       Java EE 7

*Servlet lifecycle
1. initialization
  - The init() method will be called upon the creation of servlet and it is only called once.
2. request handling
  - Request handling is handled by the method service() which is basically the main method that handles the tasks of each request
    it uses multi-threading to do the tasks.
   - The service() method is called multiple times depending on the number of requests of the user.
3. destruction
- The destruction is handled by the method destroy() which is invoked the website? is done using the object method. 

HTTP Servlet
- used to handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses
- the service() method call is connected to a doXXX call (e.g. doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), doDelete())
- the doXXX() methods passes 2 arguements which are HTTPServletRequest and HTTPServletResponse

HTTPServletRequest
- used to access information from the request message
  (Needs to be put in a table)
  Method Summary
  https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html

HTTPServletResponse 
- used to access information from the response message
(Needs to be put in a table)
 Method Summary
 https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/ServletResponse.html
 


* The web container also facilitates the conversion from HTTP response to HTTPServletResponse or from HTTP request to HTTPServletRequest.

PHP
History
PHP originally stands for "Personal Home Page Tools". PHP was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdof. Later that year, he dropped the name PHP and changed it to FI, an abbreviation for Forms Interpreter. It was originally intended for forms in HTML. Though in the October of 1995, Rasmus released a rewritten code bringing back the name PHP but with the meaning "Personal Home Page Construction Kit". From this, it went through a lot of development process and these are the versions and there release date:
PHP 1.0 - June 8 1995

Introduction
In the following lessons, it is expected that you know HTML, CSS, JavaScript and setting up a web server.
PHP today means "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" and is known as a scripting language for server-side web development. It is used mainly for making webpages dynamic and interactive. PHP is server-side programming language that runs on web servers. This means that when it is executed, it is executed in the server and nowhere else. PHP scripts must run on web servers or it will not work.

Syntax
PHP scripts can be placed anywhere in an HTML or you can make a separate file with .php as the file extension.
PHP scripts start with <?php and ends with ?>.
Example:
<?php
	echo "Hello World!";
?> 
Note: PHP statements end with a semicolon(;).

Case Sensitivity
All PHP keywords, functions, classes, and user defined functions are NOT case-sensitive.
Example:
echo "Hello"; is the same as
EcHo "Hello";

Comments
To put single line comments, we use (//) or (#) followed by a word or a sentence.
To put multi-line comments, we use /* and */.
Example:
// Single line
# Single line
/*
 Multiline
 Multiline
*/

Variables
There are rules to follow when finding for the perfect variable name. These rules are:
 - The first character must be a dollar sign ($).
 - A variable name must be at least one character in length.
 - The character after the dollar sign ($) must either be a letter or an underscore (_) and following characters can be a letter, underscore or a number.
 - Spaces or special characters other than _ and $ are not allowed in any part of the variable name.
 Examples of legal variable names in PHP:
 	$_var
	$var
	$var_one
 Examples of illegal variable name in PHP:
	var
	$var one
	$var-one

Data Types
PHP has 8 data types mainly String, Integer, Float, Boolean, Array, Object, NULL, and Resource
A String is just a sequence of characters enclosed by either the single quotes or the double quotes.
Example:
$string = "Hello There";
$string_two = 'Hi there';

An Integer is a data type that is non-decimal.
Example:
$x = 219;
$y = 2;

A float is a number with a decimal point or exponential form.
Example:
$z = 12.345;

A boolean data type represents two possible values: either a TRUE or a FALSE.
Example:
$a = TRUE;
$b = FALSE;

An array is a special data type that can store multiple informations in one single variable.
Example:
$school = array("SCIS",1,"SABM",2);

An object is a data type which stores data and information and how those informations can be used.
Example:
class School {
	 function School() {
	   this->dept = "CS";
	 }
}

$sc = new School();
echo $sc->dept;

A NULL value is a special data type which can only have a value NULL. A variable with a null value is a variable with non value assigned to it.
Example:
$x = 3;
$x = null;

A Resource type is actually not a data type. It stores the reference to functions in external resources. One good example for this is a database call.
